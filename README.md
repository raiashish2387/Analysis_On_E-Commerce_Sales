# Analysis_On_E-Commerce_Sales
In this case study, we will analyze sales data for an e-commerce platform. The dataset consists of three tables: orders, customers, and products. Our objective is to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and sales trends. We will utilize advanced joins, nested queries, and advanced subqueries to combine data from multiple tables, extract specific information, and perform complex filtering and calculations. By applying these techniques, we will analyze sales performance by customer and product, identify top-selling products within categories, and determine average order value. This case study will provide hands-on experience in analyzing sales data using advanced SQL techniques.
